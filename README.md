![DashTerm Icon](Dashterm.png)
DashTerm is an easy to use , open-source TUI dashboard which enables you to view all the essential data you need at your workplace in a single glance.

**What's the app actually doing ? 🤔**
This app helps you in marking your events throughout the day, jotting down tasks, tracking down habits, logging journals and time-boxing work with pomo sessions - all enhancing your overall productivity with lightning speed ⚡
And all this information is constantly synced with your cloud services ! 

**Why use a TUI for this? 🤔**
TUI is one of the most frictionless ways to interact with data without getting involved in UI/UX traps.
Over time, it becomes more efficient for inputting or viewing high frequency datapoints.

### Contributing ♥

Currently, there are very few limited applications in the market, that could provide a single glance view of all the essential components of a work management system for a developer. 

The definition of a work management system itself varies quite differently across devs, orgs and groups.
>*DashTerm could become a personalised plug-play TUI tool for everyone to manage their work effectively and enhance their productivity with plugins they feel empowered with .* 

Achieving this humoungous task, is only a possiblity with your contributions to this project through bug reporting, proposing enhacements, documenting, code contributing and much more.
