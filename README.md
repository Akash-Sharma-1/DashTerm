## Contributing ‚ô•

Currently, there are very few limited applications in the market, that could provide a single glance view of all the essential components of a work management system for a developer. 

The definition of a work management system itself varies quite differently across devs, orgs and groups.
>*DashTerm could become a personalised plug-play TUI tool for everyone to manage their work effectively and enhance their productivity with plugins they feel empowered with .* 

Achieving this humoungous task, is only a possiblity with your contributions to this project through bug reporting, proposing enhacements, documenting, code contributing and much more.
